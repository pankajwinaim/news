## Why...

### Was this project created?
Integration with native is notoriously difficult, especially if you don't
have experience with Java, Objective-C, and/or Swift.  We wanted to make
navigation as painless as possible while using the native stack and still
allowing native developers full control... and to have a little fun while
doing it.
